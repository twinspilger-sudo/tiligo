/*
  # Stripe Integration Schema

  1. New Tables
    - `stripe_customers`: Links Supabase users to Stripe customers
      - Includes `user_id` (references `auth.users`)
      - Stores Stripe `customer_id`
      - Implements soft delete

    - `stripe_subscriptions`: Manages subscription data
      - Tracks subscription status, periods, and payment details
      - Links to `stripe_customers` via `customer_id`
      - Custom enum type for subscription status
      - Implements soft delete

    - `stripe_orders`: Stores order/purchase information
      - Records checkout sessions and payment intents
      - Tracks payment amounts and status
      - Custom enum type for order status
      - Implements soft delete

  2. Views
    - `stripe_user_subscriptions`: Secure view for user subscription data
      - Joins customers and subscriptions
      - Filtered by authenticated user

    - `stripe_user_orders`: Secure view for user order history
      - Joins customers and orders
      - Filtered by authenticated user

  3. Security
    - Enables Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
    - Implements policies for authenticated users to view their own data
